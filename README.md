# MemoryDumpAnalyzer
- The goal of this project is to develop a Windows debugger automation tool in Python which runs
a set of commands, collects and processes the results and then reports the essential sections in a
well organized text report. The resulting text includes explanations and summaries describing
each important part of the dump file analysis to help clients determine and analyze the causes of
the crashes.
# Extra Info
-  WINDBG (Windows Debugger) MUST BE INSTALLED.
-  The program must be run with administative privilages to work properly.
-  Utilizes a custom library named `file_write`, mainly for structuring the info file as well as the explanations.
