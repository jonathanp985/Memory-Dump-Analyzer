         SYNOPSIS
___________________________

This section provides general details about the dump file and the system at the time of the crash.
The dump file captures a snapshot of the system's state during the crash, including memory, processor state, and active processes.
This information is crucial for understanding the context of the crash. 
For instance, the dump file type (e.g., kernel dump, complete dump, or small memory dump) indicates the scope of the captured data, with kernel dumps being the most common for system-level issues.
The operating system version and build number (e.g., Windows 10.0.18362) help identify the specific environment in which the crash occurred, 
Which is important because certain issues may be specific to particular OS versions or builds. System uptime, which could be something like "'2 days 4:32:15.123,'" indicates how long the system had been running since the last reboot.
Which provides insights into whether the crash might be related to long-term resource usage or other uptime-related factors.
These pieces of information are essential for diagnosing and troubleshooting the root cause of the crash.

Each data point in this section:

    - A Synopsis is given with a breif explanation of the BUGCHECK analysis.

    - Windows gives robust documentaion on each Bugcheck error code

    THREAD AND STACK INFO
_______________________________

This section provides details about the active threads and their call stacks at the time of the crash. 
It includes a list of all active threads, their states, and the functions they were executing. 
For example, the command ~*k might show that thread ID 1234 was executing a function in the ntdll module.

    - Bug Check Code (00000000`0000000a): Indicates the specific error or exception that caused the bug check (often known as a "Blue Screen of Death" or BSOD).

    - Parameter 1 (ffff818a`f5ce9010): The first parameter passed to the bug check function, often representing a memory address related to the error.

    - Parameter 2 (00000000`00000002): The second parameter, which can represent an additional detail about the error, such as an IRQL level.

    - Parameter 3 (00000000`00000000): The third parameter, indicates additional status or error information.

    - Function Name (nt!KeBugCheckExample): The name of the function where the bug check occurred, typically within the kernel or operating system.

      SYSTEM STATE INFO
_______________________________

This section provides a snapshot of the system state during the crash, including memory usage, disk activity, and network status. 
Commands like !vm can provide information such as total physical memory, free memory, and page file usage. For instance, the system might have 8191 MB of physical memory with 2048 MB free at the time of the crash. 
High memory usage or disk activity could indicate resource exhaustion, memory leaks, or I/O bottlenecks. Network status might reveal issues with network drivers or excessive network traffic. 
This information helps diagnose whether the crash was related to system resource constraints, helping to identify potential hardware failures or software inefficiencies that need to be addressed.

Each data point this section:

Page File Information:
    - Page File: The location of the page file on disk (e.g., C:\pagefile.sys).

    - Current: The current size of the page file in kilobytes.

    - Free Space: The amount of free space available in the page file.

    - Minimum: The minimum size that the page file can be.

    - Maximum: The maximum size that the page file can reach.

    - Physical Memory Information:

    - Physical Memory: The total amount of physical RAM available.

    - Available Pages: The number of available memory pages.

    - ResAvail Pages: The number of resident available pages.

    - Locked IO Pages: Pages locked in memory for I/O operations.

    - Free System PTEs: The number of free Page Table Entries, which manage virtual memory.

Commit Information:
    - Processor Commit: The amount of memory committed by the processor.

    - Session Commit: The amount of memory committed by user sessions.
